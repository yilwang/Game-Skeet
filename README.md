# Game-Skeet
# Project Skeet(With Personal Modification-Color of the Skeet,Scoring Display)

In this class, students are encouraged to create their own projects. In our team of four, we decided that our projects are to help students accomplish the learning principles of object oriented programming in C++ with making 4 games in this class. The 4 games use the same simplified OpenGL libraries as the other projects.





Create a game that simulates skeet shooting according the course requirements.Skeet or Trap Shooting is a game played by hunters where a clay pigeon is ejected from a throwing device and a marksman attempts to shoot them with a shotgun.
